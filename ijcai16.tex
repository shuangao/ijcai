\title{Safety Multiclass Incremental Transfer Learning}

\begin{abstract}
In transfer learning, Hypothesis Transfer Learning is proposed where we can only access to the models of the source domain rather than the data. In practice, in order to accept new category for HTL as the target task, we have to collect the data by ourselves. Without accessing the original data of the source domain, we have to evaluate the models for the models of original category as well.
In order to solve this problem, we propose our method, called Safety Multiclass Incremental Transfer Learning (SMITLe). SMITLe can distinguish the utility of the source models effectively. We show that the transfer parameters learned from SMITLe can avoid negative transfer and SMITLe converges at a logarithmic rate. We design 3 sets of experiment that would happen in real learning scenario. Experimental results show that SMITLe can consistently achieve higher accuracy compared to previous methods.
